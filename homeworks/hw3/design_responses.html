							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>  I really appreciated how in depth this article was. It was full of information
								on everything regarding typography. I think font is integral in design, and learning
								the 'golden ratio' of font sizes was really helpful.

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article, like stated before was the golden ratio
								font sizes.I find this incredibly helpful as I find myself constanting checking
								which number of pixels fits the best for fonts of different purposes. I also thought
								the style guide idea was super cool too.
