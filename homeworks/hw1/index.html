<h2><strong><em>Cognitive Science</em></strong></h2>
<p>
    Hi! My name is Wendy and I'm a Cognitive Science Major here at UC Berkeley.
    This semester is my last semester here, which I'm super excited and nervous about.
    During the Summer I'll be living in Los Angeles before leaving for South Korea. I enjoy
    watching movies, traveling, and trying new foods.

        From the article, I have learnt to be critical yet aware of all the design
        choices that are made by developers. Being hyper-aware of these different design choices
        will allow me as a designer to develop the 'design eye' that is supports my own work.

         I really appreciated how the article gave real life examples of apps and their design choices.
         The article itself was designed well for user experience and understanding.

        "You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product."

        To me the article was a 8, as it was easy to read and understand. Like I stated before,
        the article itself is well designed although I do wish it was longer.
