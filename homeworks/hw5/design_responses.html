                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I'm not sure if I got a link to the incorrect article but there was no reading involved.
                                I did see a lot of great transitions and UI displays and examples that I thought were 
                                really cool. I definitely did learn a lot of new cool designs and how much depth UI can achieved
                                with graphics.     
                            </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I thought the add to cart shoe app display was super cool. It is a bit
                                extra but I do think the interactivness of it was super cool. The crypto
                                app was also very fitting to what it is (futuristic).    
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> The 'selected works transitions' piece was my favorite since the transitions were very unique 
                                and visually appealing, just like the art content. I think all the displays actually aligned well
                                with the content they were tryingn to present. Like mentioned above, the crypto one was
                                futuristic, and even the architectural one was super fitting. They all so a great job at
                                presenting transitions.

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> 6. I think the article is cool for inspiration but kind of useless to beginners as we don't know how to implement
                                    lots of the designs presented.
